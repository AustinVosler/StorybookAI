## Inspiration

We aimed to create an inclusive, interactive storytelling platform that empowers young children to enjoy personalized stories, enhancing creativity, imagination, and early literacy skills.

## What It Does

StorybookAI is an interactive web application powered by Python's Flask framework, integrated seamlessly with Google's Gemini AI. Users simply speak or type a prompt, and the AI generates a delightful, five-page children's story.

Each page of the story comes to life with vibrant, AI-generated illustrations perfectly tailored to the storyline. Additionally, StorybookAI supports children who are still developing their reading skills by reading the stories aloud, providing a captivating audio narration.

## How We Built It

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- Backend: Python (Flask)

- AI Story Generation: Google Gemini API

## Features

- Interactive Prompts: Accepts user input via speech or text.

- Dynamic Stories: Automatically generates creative, engaging 5-page stories.

- Custom Illustrations: Unique, relevant images generated for each story page.

- Audio Narration: Stories are read aloud, supporting early readers and non-readers.

## Challenges

Integrating multiple APIs smoothly was our primary challenge. There were some issues with multi-platform development (Windows, Mac OS) that we had to work around.

## What's Next

Expanding from the free tier could allow for more stylized, consistent images. Also, given more time, we would have implemented the ability to save previous stories and to expand stories past 5 pages.
