Shadowfeather the raven lived high in the tallest oak of Evergreen Echoes Forest. From his cozy nest, he loved to watch the world wake up below.
One sunny morning, he spotted something twinkling brightly far below in a clearing. "Caw! What could that be?" he wondered.
He swooped down, down, down to the soft grassy clearing called Sparklepatch Meadow. There, a small, lost firefly named Flicker was trying to fix his broken glow-lantern!
"Caw! Can I help you, little one?" asked Shadowfeather kindly. Flicker explained his light was dim, and Shadowfeather carefully used his strong beak to mend a loose wire.
"Hooray!" chirped Flicker, his lantern now glowing brightly. They played hide-and-seek among the tall grasses until the sun began to set, then Shadowfeather flew happily home.
