Meet Iggy, the Iridescent Iguana, who lived high in the tallest tree on the Emerald Canopy Coast. His scales shimmered like a rainbow when the sun peeked through the leaves.
One sunny morning, Iggy decided to climb down his tree to find the sweetest jungle berries for breakfast. He stretched his little claws, ready for adventure.
As he neared the ground, Iggy spotted something round and shiny nestled among the roots â€“ it was a tiny, lost sparkle-stone!
Iggy gently nudged the sparkle-stone with his nose, wondering where such a pretty thing came from. It felt warm and comforting.
He carefully picked it up and decided to carry his new treasure back up to his cozy branch, knowing it would make a perfect glow-lamp for his home. Iggy smiled, feeling happy with his find.
